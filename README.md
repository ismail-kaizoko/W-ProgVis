# W-ProgVis 

This is a personal Web-App to track and boost personal self progress and grow through insightfull visuals. 
The key is to motivate discipline and consitency, specially through hard tasks where the ROI, or the reward system takes quite a long time, which in a highly addictive domaine-accros is usually nuglected. the app solves this by giving a track on a daily basis, serving as a motivation before the reward hits the person back. 

If you feel yourself capable, and worthy of smtg and wanna challenge your confort zone ? Do you need that first push ? W-ProgVis is here, pull that dusty TO-DO list, get off your gaming chair position, and get to wor !!!


### Current state : 
Visual 1 : A Radar-chart of self personal grow : you whose at least three axis of your growth, at each day you give a +1 to an axis you have touched, pushing the boundaries further, in a matter of some days you will notice clearely a difference. the chart keep a track of your state at a 20 days before, showing the amount of progress you made for each axes.
> rules : 
- you can't score more than +1 to an axis a day, we cherish consistensy and disciplin
- if you haven't worked on some axis for 4 days, it automatically gives you a negatove score -1, shrinking the radar chart instead of spreading.
- reaching higher scores becomes more difficult by time, reaching 100% (it is just how life works)

Visual 2 :
A bar plot : keeping a track of a specefic habit you want to built on a DAILY basis, it can customized to anything : how any pushups you did in a day, pages you read, hours of working on yourself, minute of jogging ....
This is the best plot to transfer your thought from "ONE DAY" to "DAY ONE"
<insert image at right>

> rules : 
- simple, each day enter a number, and see the bars speak for them selves, naturally it keeps the person to not break the beautiful pattern, serving as a  positive hook to keep the habit. Consistency is an art, and not everyone is an artist (wink smiley) 


Visual 3 : 
A pie chart that tracks your daily performance and organisation, it demands a little discipline to track your activities during the day, the plot gives an idea of where your day is Gone, your objective is to combat the "WASTED" in balck color, that Black corner is where usually where one's life get wasted : DoomScrolling, watching TV, Gaming ..., chilling activities but too dangerous if they become excessive. FIGHT THE DARKNESS (sword emojy).

> rules : 
- each day enter your daily track of hours, by the end of a week/month a summary is given to you, forshowing that we do have time, but bad managment.





### Future plans : 
Introduce a RANKED system, just similar to what in competitive games, where ranks will be attributed to each user, giving the higher ranks obviously to the most discipled users who kept a steady progress through a long window of time, who challenged themselves and reached their better versions. a leadrboard will be shared across all users. Let's see who is going to be our OBSYDIAN ( black ruby emoji ) -->

#### 💪 What Is This?

This is a personal Web-App to track and boost personal self-progress and growth through insightful visuals. The key is to **motivate discipline and consistency**, especially through hard tasks where the ROI, or the reward system takes quite a long time *(which is usually hard specially in this domapine era)*. The app helps by giving you a track on a daily basis, serving as *motivation* before the taks rewards you back.

>>> **Time to pull that Dusty TO-DO list and get to work 🔥🗡️**

### Current Features

##### Visual 1: Radar Chart of Personal Growth

<img src="docs/images/radar.png" align="right" width="450" alt="Radar Chart Example" />

You choose at least three axes of your desired growth. At each day you give a **+1** to an axis you have invested in (could be reading some pages, exercising ...), pushing the boundaries further. In a matter of some days, you will notice clearly a difference. The chart keeps a track of your state from 20 days before, showing the amount of progress you made for each axis.

###### 📋 Rules:
- You **can't score more than +1** to an axis per day no matter the effort put—we cherish consistency and discipline-
- If you haven't worked on an axis for **4 days**, it automatically gives you a **negative score (-1)**, shrinking the radar chart instead of spreading, meaning you loose progress the moment you stop, so keep it up.
- Reaching higher scores becomes **more difficult over time**, approaching 100% is quite chellenging, but not imposible *(it is just how life works)*

##### Visual 3: Time Management Pie Chart

<img src="docs/images/pie.png" align="right" width="450" alt="Pie Chart Example" />

A pie chart that tracks your daily performance and organization. It demands a little discipline to track your activities during the day. The plot gives an idea of where your day has gone. Your objective is to **combat the "WASTED"** in black color.

That **black corner** is where usually one's life gets wasted: DoomScrolling, watching TV, gaming... chilling activities yes, one has right to rest, but too dangerous if they become excessive.

>>>**FIGHT THE DARKNESS ⚔️**

###### 📋 Rules:
- Each day enter your daily track of hours

#### 🚀 Future Plans

##### Ranked System 🏆

Introduce a **RANKED system**, just similar to what's in competitive games, where ranks will be attributed to each user. The higher ranks will obviously go to the most disciplined users who kept a steady progress through a long window of time, who challenged themselves and reached their better versions.

A **leaderboard** will be shared across all users. **Let's see who is going to be our OBSIDIAN 💎**
